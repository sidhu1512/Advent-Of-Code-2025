# Day 1: Secret Entrance (Part One)

Approach & Thought Process

The dial functions as a circular array (buffer) of size 100.
Input Parsing: 
- Read the input stream line by line.
- Separate the direction ('L' or 'R') from the magnitude (the number).

Normalization:
Since the dial is circular (0-99), a rotation of 150 is effectively the same as 50.
I used the modulo operator (rotation % 100) to simplify the magnitude before calculating the new position.

State Management:
I maintain a dial variable tracking the current position.
- Right (R): Add the rotation. If it exceeds 99, subtract 100 (wrap around).
- Left (L): Subtract the rotation. If it drops below 0, add 100 (wrap around).

Condition Checking:
After applying the logic, check if dial == 0. If yes, increment the count.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)
We process the input file line-by-line once. N is the number of instructions.
Space Complexity: O(1)
We stream the input using BufferedReader and only store a few integer variables for the state.

# Day 1: Secret Entrance (Part Two)

Approach & Thought Process

Instead of just checking the final resting position, we need to count how many times the dial crosses or lands on the 0 mark during a continuous spin.

Mathematical Calculation:
- For each instruction, the number of full revolutions is determined using integer division (magnitude / 100).
- An additional crossing is counted if the final position wraps past zero relative to the starting position for that specific move. This avoids simulating every single step.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)
Direct mathematical calculation for each line keeps it linear.
Space Complexity: O(1)
No additional memory required beyond standard state variables.
